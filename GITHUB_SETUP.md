# GitHub Setup Instructions

Since you don't have SSH keys set up, you'll need to use HTTPS with a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication.

## Steps to push your project:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "tax-assistant-push"
   - Select scopes: at least `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Generate the token and copy it immediately (you won't see it again)

2. **Push your project (force push to replace remote contents):**
   ```bash
   # When prompted for password, use your Personal Access Token instead
   git push -f origin main
   ```

3. **Push the feature branch too:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/delegated-laws
   git push -u origin feature/delegated-laws
   ```

## Alternative: Keep existing remote history

If you want to preserve the remote repository's history:
```bash
# Fetch remote content
git fetch origin

# Merge or rebase your changes on top
git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories
# OR
git rebase origin/main
```

## Note about authentication:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

The token acts as your password for HTTPS Git operations.
